# Embedded Lua
Embedding Lua in to C++

To be used in a C++ based game engine focused on loosely coupled classes, ease of modification, and readability. 

# More about the engine
Project for 3rd year university unit focused on creating a game engine generic enough to allow various games to be implemented without coupling game design and game logic to the engine.

Goals include 
- Implementation of well know design patterns to overcome typical problems encountered in game engine design
- Use of interfaces to access core engine components thus supporting plugging in different libraries where required (facade pattern), ideally promoting platform independance
- A scripting engine to allow scripting of NPC behaviours, de-coupling behaviours from the engine code itself, allowing greater flexability and ease of implementation/testing
- Most importantly of all a learning experience in software architecture design and implementation, with a focus on clean code, loosely coupled classes, and extensibility.
